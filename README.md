# Fractional Over Collateralized Stablecoin (FOX)

```
DAI + FRAX = FOX
```

---

# Requirements

```bash
$ yarn install
```

# Set `.env`

and/or `.env.test` for test environment.

Now we can use pre-defined values as environment variable, with a command prefix `dotenv -e .env.test --`.

# Deploy

```bash
$ dotenv -e .env.test -- npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network localhost
```

How to increase capital efficiency?
- increase maxLTV: more easy, but more risky
- increase service's trust: in some ways, more risky. But collaterals are SAFU
- increase both maxLTV and trust: ðŸ˜²

Solve Stablecoin's trilemma
